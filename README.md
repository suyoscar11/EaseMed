## General info

Every year the world spends around $8.3 trillion in the health sector, and a hefty amount of money goes into the health transportation system. Therefore, we created EaseMed, aiming to solve the world's medical problems. As the whole world suffering through this pandemic and considering the fact that not knowing your health status is not the best thing you want to hear, we created EaseMed; a system that provides all medical services on your smartphone. With the help of advanced Machine Learning tools at its heart that user can chat with users to talk about their mental health and summarize the important health news for users.

The goal of EaseMed is not only to act as a digital medical system but be a one-stop solution for all medical needs. EaseMed scrapes the web/google news to provide a summary of all international news from portals like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and much more related to climate change topics. On top of that, Frida also scrapes Nepali news portals like OnlineKhabar, and Setopati to bring the users local news on health.

###  Note: We Couldn't build as big app as we wanted due to limited space on free servers. Also, we were unable to deploy chatbot model on app because  pytorch required 700 MB and tensorflow requires 1.2 GB space which was not available to us. Still the model, its data generation and data analysics can be viewed on the jupyter notebook on the [chatbot](https://github.com/yubrajbhandari923/EaseMed/blob/main/backend_code/chatbot/Chatbot-for-mental-health/Models/Retrieval_based.ipynb) repo. time constraint was also a factor to built a dataset from ground up and train excellent model in it
